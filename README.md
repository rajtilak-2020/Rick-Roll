# Rick-Roll üï∫üèª
In this project, I utilize a simple batch file (.bat) to fetch an ASCII art of the Rickroll using the curl command, directly from the ascii.live/rick endpoint. This demonstrates the ability to automate terminal commands and leverage external APIs through scripting.

# Key Technical Aspects:

- Batch File (.bat): A Windows batch script automates the execution of terminal commands. In this case, it contains the curl command to retrieve Rickroll ASCII art from a web service.

- curl Command: This is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server. In the .bat file, curl ascii.live/rick fetches an ASCII-encoded Rickroll and displays it in the Command Prompt.
   Integration with External APIs: The script shows how to pull data from a web service (ascii.live) and output it into a local environment, showcasing a basic form of API interaction.
- Automation and Customization: By saving the .bat file, users can automate the process of displaying the Rickroll in ASCII whenever needed with a simple double-click.

  
This is a fun example of how simple batch scripts can be used to create interactive experiences, demonstrate automation skills, and make use of web services within a local terminal environment.
